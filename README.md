This repository will be my folder where I will upload all the C# codes that I will make to learn this programming language.

What do you need to run the programs in this project? (The programs are console-based)

    1)You need to have C# installed.
    2)When you clone the repository, you need to navigate to the subfolder of the program you want to run.
    3)In the terminal, you should use the command: dotnet run.
